# Covid Effects on AirBnB in NYC - Data Analysis<br>

This project analyzes AirBnB data in New York City Before and After Covid, trying to find and analyze the effects Covid has on the AirBnB listings and reviews with emphasis on analyzing the listing’s names, descriptions and user’s reviews. The data for this project has come from multiple sources listed below.
This analysis is divided into 2 main parts:
Initial Comparison - Some basic comparison of AirBnB data between the Pre-Covid period to Covid Period
Further Comparison - This part is mostly based on different NLP techniques to see if there is a difference between Listing’s names, descriptions and reviews between the 2 periods, and testing for different correlations between the text to other data.
